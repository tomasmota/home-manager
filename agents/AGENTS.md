# This machine
- My terminal is ghostty
- Almost everything is configured using home-manager. All config is located at `~/.config/home-manager/`. If I ask you to change some configuration in home-manager, this is where you will find it. Read `~/.config/home-manager/AGENTS.md` for more information.

# Tips for you
- if you want to run kubectl commands, first check my contexts with `kubectl config get-contexts`
- it's more important to me that you give me accurate information, than being quick to answer. I would rather you take a long time but do good reasearch with google search tools and reading as much documentation as possible and adequate

# Git
- never commit or push changes for me unless explicitly asked to
